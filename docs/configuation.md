# Configuation

## useGPU

If you have one or more GPUs, they will be used for mining by default. Currently only Nvidia cards are supported, and the default behavior will work well for miners.

You can configure your GPUs as you wish by adding / editing the following lines in your config.json file:

```text
"useGPU":true,
        "gpuConfig":{
        "default":{
            "groupSize":256,
            "groups":4096,
            "count":16
        }
    },
```

If you have multiple GPUs connected, you can specify different config settings for each card in the following format:

```text
"gpuConfig":{
        "<GPUName1>":{
            "groupSize":256,
            "groups":4096,
            "count":16
        },
        "<GPUName2>":{
            "groupSize":256,
            "groups":4096,
            "count":16
        }, 
        "<GPUName3>":{
            "disabled":true
        },

    }
```

Replace "GPUName1" with system name for each card. On most systems you can get a list of GPUs with `nvidia-smi -l`

You may edit the variables to try to improve hashrate for your GPU model:

* disabled: boolean on whether or not to disable a specific GPU
* groupSize - number of groups to split work into
* groups - number of groups of work submitted to the gpu at once
* count: number of hashes each thread executes in one pass

{% hint style="info" %}
Edit these variables at your own risk! Reach out to the community if you're unsure.
{% endhint %}

## Connecting to a Pool

There are mining pools available for mining TRB without staking 500 tokens. The pool server operator stakes 500 tokens for you, and you receive rewards roughly proportional to your hashrate as a fraction of the pool's hashrate.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each pool as different fees and instructions for hooking up. Be sure to read your pools documentation. Feel free to reach out to the community if you need help with mining pools.
{% endhint %}

Add the following lines to your config file:

```text
"enablePoolWorker": true,
"poolURL": "<poolURL>",
```

Where the poolURL is the link to your pool. \(e.g. [http://tellorpool.org](http://tellorpool.org) \)

You can change the job duration if needed. This is the time in seconds to grab information from the pool. The default time is 15 seconds.

```text
"poolJobDuration":10
```

## Running a Remote Data Server for Multiple Miners

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are setting up a Tellor miner for the first time, it might be a good idea to skip this section and come back after you're up and running with one miner.
{% endhint %}

If you are running multiple miners, there is no reason to run multiple databases \(the values you will submit should be identical\). In addition, querying the same API from multiple processes can lead to rate limits on the public API's. To get around this, you can utilize a system where you run one.

`tellor dataServer`

You can then start multiple miners that all read off the one database.

`tellor mine -r`

Create a config file for the dataServer and add the public addresses of all remote miners that want to read the database: \(0x prefix is retained here\)

```text
    “serverWhitelist”: [
        "0xyour-miner-address1",
        "0xyour-miner-address2"
    ]
```

Create a separate copy of config.json for each miner and edit these to match your miner's characteristics.

In both your miner and dataServer config files, you must change the IP addresses to match the server and port you are hosting/reading from.

```text
   "serverHost": "1.2.3.4",
   "serverPort": 5000,
```

Note that your dataServer and miners must be started with separate commands.
