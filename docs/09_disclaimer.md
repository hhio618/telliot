# Disclaimer

If you are building a competing client, please contact us.  A lot of the miner specifications are off-chain and a significant portion of the mining process hinges on the consensus of the Tellor community to determine what proper values are.  Competing clients that change different pieces run the risk of being disputed by the community.

As an example, request ID 4 is BTC/USD. If the api's all go down, it is the responsibility of the miner to still submit a valid BTC/USD price. If they do not, they risk being disputed and slashed. For these reasons, please contribute openly to the official Tellor miner \(or an open source variant\), as consensus here is key. If your miner gets a different value than the majority of the other miners, you risk being punished!
